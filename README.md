# Personal Website

This is my personal website. I have taken effort to make it as minimalistic as possible while remaining pleasing to the eye. Originally, the site was just a bunch of static files but I swapped this out for [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) for a few reasons:

- I've had an interest in learning Jekyll and this seemed to be a perfect use-case.
- I've been putting off writing blog posts for a while partially due to the headache of managing a bunch of individual html files.
- Jekyll's ecosystem has great plugins that do things such as automate SEO meta tags and archive old posts.
