# About Me

{% include nav.html %}

My name is Kyle Dormer and I'm a 20 year old undergraduate Computing student at the University of Gloucestershire. I have a deeply ingrained love of computers that stems from tinkering about with them from a very young age, a love that led me to pick up programming at the age of 14. From my humble beginnings making Minecraft mods in Java, I am now primarily interested in web development in its many shapes and forms.

So far, my professional experience has mainly involved using a mix of PHP, HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I have worked not only with these technologies 'from scratch' but also in the context of various CMS systems such as Magento (1 & 2) and Wordpress.

In my spare time I enjoy bushcraft, hiking, reading, fitness, history and music.

I've created this website for a few reasons. First and foremost, I've come to realise that having a personal website is a freeing experience. This may sound strange but compare it to social media. On social media not only is your self-expression moderated but any content that you do create belongs to that corporation. Compare this to having a personal website, here I can host anything I wish, I can express myself forthrightly, and all of the content created here is my own intellectual property.

Secondly, in this day and age and especially in the profession that I wish to go into, it's beneficial to have an online presence. So while this is my personal site, it will also contain ongoing projects that I'm working on, and new things that I learn.

Finally, I thought it would be an interesting experiment to hold myself accountable in keeping to my good habits by leveraging public accountability in the form of posting daily (or weekly) updates here. More details about my motivations behind this experiment of mine can be found [here]({% post_url 2021-04-29-habits %}).
