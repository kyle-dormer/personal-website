# About Me.

{% include nav.html %}

My name is Kyle Dormer and I'm a 20 year old undergraduate Computing student at the University of Gloucestershire. I have a deeply ingrained love of computers that stems from tinkering about with them from a very young age, a love that led me to pick up programming at the age of 14. From my humble beginnings making Minecraft mods in Java, I am now primarily interested in web development in its many shapes and forms.

So far, my professional experience has mainly involved using a mix of PHP, HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I have worked not only with these technologies 'from scratch' but also in the context of various CMS systems such as Magento (1 & 2) and Wordpress.

In my spare time I enjoy bushcraft, hiking, reading, fitness, history and music.
