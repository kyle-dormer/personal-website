    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>
      I am a first-year (very soon to be second-year) undergraduate student of
      Computing at the University of Gloucestershire. My biggest interest within
      the realm of computing is full-stack web development although I am more
      partial to the backend side of things. I'm currently learning and
      experimenting with
      <a href="https://laravel.com/" target="_blank">Laravel</a>, which I'm
      finding to be very comfy to use and develop with, and a nice breath of
      fresh air to the usual full-JavaScript stack that so many evangelise these
      days.
    </p>

    <p>
      Outside of the subject my biggest interests lie in Bushcraft, reading and
      the guitar - they go together a lot more than you would expect! In my
      view, the natural world is sustaining far too much damage, so much so that
      even in my rural village area I've taken to taking a bin-bag out with me
      because the obscene amount of litter I walk past on the way to the local
      woods is downright <em>infuriating</em>. Although my preferences for
      privacy point me towards search engines such as
      <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/" target="_blank">DuckDuckGo</a> or, even
      better, a random
      <a href="https://searx.space/" target="_blank">Searx instance</a>, I
      highly recommend and will unashamedly evangelise for the usage of
      <a href="https://www.ecosia.org/" target="_blank">Ecosia</a>. They are not
      quite as private as I would like (although
      <strong>far, far</strong> better than the likes of Google), but they are
      an extremely ethical company that is genuinely making a difference, with
      around <strong>98 million trees planted</strong> at the time of writing
      this. If there is anything you take away from this mess of a website, I
      hope it is a spark of interest in using
      <a href="https://www.ecosia.org/" target="_blank">Ecosia</a>.
