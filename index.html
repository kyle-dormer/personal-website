      content="I am currently a nineteen year old student of Computing. As it stands, my
      biggest interests are full-stack web development, Python and C. I have had
      an interest in computers for as long as I can remember and my interest in
      them only grows as my knowledge increases. Outside of university, I enjoy
      bushcraft, hiking, music and reading. This is my website."
