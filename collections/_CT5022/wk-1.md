## Introduction
Many organisations today have a new or renewed interest in project management. Various factors have radically changed the word environment:
* Computer hardware (e.g. cloud computing)
* Software (e.g. version control such as GitHub )
* Networks
* Use of interdisciplinary and global work teams

The U.S. spends $2.3 trillion on projects every year, and world as a whole spends roughly $10 trillion. Due to this, between 2010 and 2020 _15.7 million_ new project management roles have been created globally across seven project-intensive industries. 


## What is a Project?
A project is a temporary endeavour to produce a **new** and **unique** deliverable.
A deliverable could be a:
* Tangible product
* Service
* Achievement of a required outcome

A project has:
* a beginning
* an end

It is carried out to achieve a _particular purpose_ within given:
* time constraints
* cost limits

From the Office of Government Commerce, 2008:
>A unique set of coordinated activities, with definite starting and finishing points, undertaken by an individual or team to meet specific objectives within defined time, cost and performance parameters.

## Project Characteristics
* Instruments of change
* Unique
* Composed of inter-dependent activities
* Carried out by people who don't normally work together
* Temporary with defined start and end dates
* Intended to achieve a specific outcome
* Frequently risky and involving uncertainties

>Software projects are notoriously difficult to define. Unlike a building, you can't see software or touch it or feel it or visualise it and it's hard for the layman to get a conceptual grip of its size or cost or how long it might take to build.<br>
>&mdash; <cite>Mulally, M.E. 'The Accidental Project Manager: Coming in from the Cold', 2003</cite>

## What is Project Management?
Project management is:
>the application of knowledge, skills, tools and techniques to project activities to meet project requirements and stakeholders' needs and expectations<br> 
>&mdash; <cite>PMBOK Guide, 2008</cite>

Project managers strive to meet the triple constraint by __balancing project scope, time, and cost goals__ (and in 2012, the fourth constraint of collaboration).

## The Triple Constraint of Project Management
Successful project management means meeting all three goals of __scope__, __time__ and __cost__ as well as satisfying the project's sponsor.
* Projects must be delivered within cost.
* Projects must be delivered on time.
* Projects must meet the agreed scope - no more, no less.

### The Fourth Constraint
As the project environment grows in complexity, project management will require collaboration from
* the team
* the stakeholder(s)
* executives

On the job application of training, custom-made project approaches, innovative project tools and smarter resource management will be __essential__ for driving the greatest business impact.

Not only project management, but also the _definition of project success_ has changed to encompass more than the triple constraint.

Collaboration is a common theme throughout many of the 2012 _Top 10 Trends for Project Management_, which were determined by a global panel of __ESI International__ senior executives and subject matter experts.

## Advantages of Using Formal Project Management
* Better control of resources - financial, physical and human
* Improved customer relations
* Shorter development times
* Lower costs
* Higher quality and increased reliability
* Improved productivity
* Better internal coordination
* Higher worker morale (less stress)


## Project Management Framework

### Nine Project Management Knowledge Areas
"Knowledge areas" describe the _key competencies_ that project managers must develop.

Four core knowledge areas lead to specific project objectives:
* scope
* time
* cost
* quality

Four facilitating knowledge areas are the means through which the project objectives are achieved:
* human resources
* communication
* risk
* procurement management

One knowledge area (project integration management) affects and is affected by all of the other knowledge areas. __All of these knowledge areas are important!__

### Tools & Techniques
Project management tools and techniques assist project managers and their teams in various aspects of project management. Some specific ones include:
* Project charter, scope statement, and WBS (scope)
* Gantt charts, network diagrams, critical path analysis, and critical chain scheduling (time)
* Cost estimates and earned value management (cost)
* Risk registers and rankings
* Quality metrics checklists, change requests
    
## Large vs Small Projects
The Standish Group's CHAOS studies show the success/failure rates of projects.

### Why Projects Failed in the Past
The UK House of Commons Public Account Committee identified 25 projects and highlighted the following reasons for failure: 
* Not enough sense of urgency.
* Not enough support for the change.
* No vision.
* Poor communication.
* Organisational obstacles.
* No short term benefits.
* Finishing too quickly.
* No signing off, continually changing specifications and scope.

### Why the Improvements?
The reasons for the increase in successful projects vary:
* Average cost of a project has been more than cut in half.
* Better tools have been created to monitor and control progress.
* More skilled project managers.
* Better management processes are being used.
* __The fact that there are processes is significant in itself.__

## Project Success
There are several ways to define project success:
* The project met __scope__, __time__, and __cost__ goals.
* The project __satisfied__ the customer/sponsor.
* The results of the project met its main objective, such as:
    * making or saving a certain amount of money
    * providing a good return on investment
    * or simply making the sponsors happy

Below is a table of the Standish Group's CHAOS studies describing the most important factors for a project's success.

A project's success can also depend on which methodology is used. As an illustrative example, below is a table comparing the success of Agile projects to Waterfall projects.

### What the Winners Do
Recent research findings show that companies that excel in project delivery capability:
* Use an integrated project management toolbox that includes standard and advanced tools and lots of templates.
* Grow project leaders, emphasizing business and soft skills.
* Develop a streamlined project delivery process.
* Measure project health using metrics, including customer satisfaction and return on investment.

## Post-Sessional Work: Project Management Tools
* Trello - based on Kanban board, users create task boards with various columns and tasks can be organised into these - allowing users to tailor Trello to be as simple or advanced as they need. However, doesn't represent a 'full' solution.
* Asana - SaaS solution aimed to provide a single-tool solution to a team's project management needs. Features include creating projects, assigning work, specifying eadlines, team communication, files, calendars, bespoke security controls, status update and more.
* Jira &mdash; - project management and issue tracking software developed by Atlassian. Particularly tailored for Agile project management.
