## Project Quality Management
The International Organisation for Standardisation (ISO) defines __quality__ as "the degree to which a set of inherent characteristics fulfills requirements".

Other experts define quality based on:
* __Conformance to requirements__: the project's processes and products meet written specifications
* __Fitness for use__: a product can be used as it was intended

Project quality management is the 5th knowledge area within project management.

It contains knowledge and processes required to ensure the highest quality products and deliverables are required by the project.
* __Quality__: refers to how good something is compared to other similar things.
* __Grade__: the performance specification to which a product is produced.

For example, a particular child's toy might be high grade (many features etc) but if the parts break easily the quality could be unacceptable.

There are three main processes within this knowledge area:
* __Quality Plan__: the selection of the quality standards and production of the _Quality Management Plan_.
* __Planning Process__: auditing the processes being used to achieve the quality standards.
* __Controlling Process__: measuring the quality of the deliverables.

### Who is Responsible for the Quality of Projects?
Project managers are ultimately responsible for quality management on their projects.

Several organisations and references can help project managers and their teams understand quality.
* International Organisation for Standardisation
* IEEE

## Total Quality Management
Total Quality Management is a comprehensive and structured approach to organisational management that achieves best quality of produts and services, through using effective refinements in response to continuous feedback, and through using them effectively to deliver best value for the customer while achieving long term objectives of the organisation.
* TQM is a customer-focused approach
* It is a company-wide strategy and involves everyone in the organisation
* Aims at satisfying the customer or delighting them
* Provides best quality product and satisfies them in a cost-effetive manner
* Fundamental changes in basic beliefs and practises
* Prevention of defects is the aim and the target is zero defects
* Total quality management is methodical
* Provides meaningful measures of performance that guide the self-improvement efforts of everyone involved

### TQM Questions
1. Who is the customer?
2. Internal or external customer?
3. Customer expectations?
4. What method are we using?
5. What resources do we have available?
6. How motivated are the staff?

## Quality Planning
The ability to anticipate situations and prepare actions to bring about the desired outcome.

It is important to prevent defects by:
* Selecting proper materials
* Training and indoctrinating people in quality
* Planning a process that ensures the appropriate outcome

## Quality Plan
A formal definition of how the work is to be accomplished. It is a key reference point for projects team members.

It is a bridge between the customer, developer and supplier and also provides a disciplined approach to project management.

## Design of Experiments
A quality planning technique that helps identify which variables have the most influence on the overall outcome of a process.

It applies to project management issues, such as cost and schedule trade-offs.

Involves documenting important factors that directly contribtue to meeting customer requirements.

## Quality Assurance
Quality assurance includes all activities related to satisfying the relevant quality standards for a project. Another goal of quality assurance is continuous quality improvement.

Benchmarking generates ideas for quality improvements by comparing specific project practises or product characteristics to those of other projects or products within or outside the organisation.

A quality audit is a structured review of specific quality management activities that help identify lessons learned that could improve performance on current or future projects.

## Quality Control
Quality control (QC) is a proceudre or set of procedures intended to ensure that a manufactured product or performed service adheres to a defined set of quality criteria or meets the requirements of the client or customer.

## Cause-and-Effect Diagrams
Cause-and-effect diagrams trace complaints about quality problems back to the responsible production operations.

They can help you find the root cause of a problem, and are also known as fishbone or Ishikawa diagrams.

You can also use the "5 whys" technique where you repeat the question "Why" (five is a good rule of thumb) to peel away the layers of symptoms that can lead to the root cause.

### Five Whys - Root Causes
* __1st why__: Why is there oil on the floor under the press?
    * A quick look found that the main return hose was leaking.
* __2nd why__: Why is oil leaking from this hose?
    * After further investigation, it was found that the hose is rubbing on a fanbelt and had worn through.
* __3rd why__: Why is it rubbing on the fan belt?
    * More investigation found that the fan belt housing was loose.
* __4th why__: Why is the fan belt loosing so loose?
    * After another check, we found some of the bolts that hold the housing in place are not fully tensioned.
* __5th why__: Why then are the bolts loose?
    * Nobody had servived the press for over six months. (This is clearly the __ROOT__ cause of the problem).

## Project Monitoring and Controlling
Involves measuring progress toward project objectives, monitoring deviation from the plan, and taking corrective actions.

Affects all other process groups and occurs during all phases of the project life cycle.

Outputs include performance reports, requested changes and updates to various plans.

## Six Sigma
Six Sigma is a "comprehensive and flexible system" for _achieving_, _sustaining_ and _maximising_ business success.

Six Sigma is uniquely driven by close understanding of:
* customer needs
* disciplined use of facts
* data and statistical analysis
* diligent attention to managing, improving and reinventing business processes.

![Sigma](/assets/images/notes/CT5022/sigma.jpg "Six sigma")

The principles can apply to a wide variety of processes. Six Sigma projects normally follow a five-phase improvement process called DMAIC.

* __Critical to quality__: Attribtues most important to the customer.
* __Defect__: Failing to deliver what the customer wants.
* __Process Capability__: What your process can deliver
* __Variation__: What the customer sees and feels
* __Stable Operations__: Ensuring consistent, predictable processes to improve what the customer sees and feels.
* __Design for Six Sigma__: Designing to meet customer needs and process capability.

### Six Sigma Green Belt
* It requires an organisation-wide commitment.
* Training follows the "Belt" system.
* Six Sigma organisations have the ability and willingness to adopt contrary objectives, such as reducing errors and getting things done faster.
* It is an operating philosophy that is customer-focused and strives to drive out waste. raise levels of quality and improve financial performance at breakthrough levels.
* Promising quality is all about assuring the vital customers that the servives and products being provided are of the best quality.
* For delivering quality consistently, it is of paramount importance to adapt to the industry-improved testing techniques and methodologies.
* It is the job of the quality assurance officer to look after all such aspects of product development and deliver excellence.

### Six Sigma Role - Quality Assurance Officer
1. Responsible for ensuring the quality of products and services; and thereby take care of the entire process of QA in a SDLC.
2. It is a quality assurance officer's lookout to maintain the high standards of a product or service.
3. One of the most important responsibilities is that he has to improve the already set QA standards that are already set.
4. Also responsible for overviewing sales stats and checking out any possible drops in sales due to lack of quality.
5. Also responsible for making sure that the organisation's definition of quality is understood by all the employees to achieve the common goal.

It becomes crucial for a QA officer to stay current and updated with the recent product launches, seminars and workshops in quality management domain.

This practise can play a good role in maintaining the technical knowledge and keep up with the rapidly growing QA standards.

## Five Cost Categories Related to Quality

### Prevention Cost
The cost of planning and executing a project so it is error-free or within an acceptable error range.

### Appraisal Cost
The cost of evaluating processes and their outputs to ensure quality.

### Internal Failure Cost
The cost incurred to correct an identified defect before the customer receives the product.

### External Failure Cost
Cost that relates to all errors not detected and corrected before delivery to the customer.

### Measurement and Test Equipment Costs
Capital cost of equipment used to perform prevention and appraisal activities.

## Summary
Project quality management ensures that the project will satisfy the needs for which it was undertaken.

Quality iself is a vague concept and practical quality requirements have to be carefully defined.

There have to be practical ways of testing for the relative presence of absence of quality. These processes are:
* Quality planning
* Quality assurance
* Quality control
