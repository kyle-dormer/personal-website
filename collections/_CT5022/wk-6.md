## Project Management Approaches

### Waterfall

Pros:
* Simple and easy
* Specific, clear deliverables
* Works well for smaller, simpler projects
* Easy to manage and arrange

Cons:
* Too simple
* Fixed deliverables
* Testing is not done until the end, therefore high risk
* Fails if requirements change
* Integration left till end
* Difficult to quantify progress

### Agile
Agile is an iterative approach to project management and software development. It means teams deliver value to their customers faster and with fewer headaches. It advocates adaptive planning, evolutionary development, early delivery and continual improvement.

* Light-weight technology
* Small/medium sized teams
* Vague and/or changing requirements
* Vague and/or changing techniques
* Simple design

## Budget - Cost Management Plan
Accurate cost estimates help you complete a project on-budget. Before you can perform cost estimation, you need to have completed the following processes:
* Define scope
* Create WBS
* Define activities
* Sequence activities
* Estimate activity duration

## Cost Estimation Tools
* Analogous estimation
* Parametric estimation
* Bottom-up estimation

### Analogous Estimation
Estimates from a _closed project_ are used to determine the estimates for the _new project_.

For example, if your organisation has designed and developed an Intranet for another company.

The accuracy of analogous estimates is dependent on the similarities between the two projects.

### Parametric Estimation
Parametric estimation can leverage software or algorithms that take historical information as the input, makes assumptions and then extrapolates the information to compute the overall cost estimates.

__The accuracy of parametric estimation is dependent on the assumptions made!__

### Bottom-Up Estimation
In this technique, you aggregate individual estimates for each task in the WBS up until the summary node on the WBS. You would then perform this calculation for all activities.

Bottom-up estimation is fairly accurate and is possibly the most often used estimation technique for deriving the cost estimates.

Since the bottom-up technique uses estimates from a task level, it is imperative for you to make accurate task estimates.

Some best practises you should use are:
* Include subject matter experts (SMEs) in the estimation process.
* Leverage the people that will actually do the work (commonly used in Agile projects).

__A disadvantage with the technique is that the overall effort may grow with the degree of planning__.

## What is Plan Cost Management Process?
Plan cost management is the process of establishing policies, procedures, and documentation for planning, managing, expanding and controlling project costs.

There will be several project resources in a project and several different types of materials will be needed, there might be necessary tools and equipment as well.

Plan cost management processes aim to plan, manage and control these expenses in a project.

### Major Output of Plan Cost Management Process
Cost management process mainly aims to:
* determine the cost of each activity
* determine the budget of the project

The major output of this phase is the __cost management plan__.

This provides both _guidance_ and _direction_ on how to manage the project costs throughout the project.
For instance, you will be able to see how much money you will need in a certain phase of the project.

### What Questions are Answered in the Cost Management Plan?
The cost management plan briefly describes:
* how to estimate costs 
* how to determine the budget

After the budget is determined, it describes how to manage and control costs.

It answers two main questions.

#### "How Will I Go About Planning Costs for the Project?"
The cost management plan will guide you on how to estimate costs for each project activity and deliverable as well as how to construct the overall project budget.

#### "How Will I Manage the Project to the Cost Baseline?"
After the budget of the project is determined, cost baseline is taken. The cost management plan will guide you on when to spend and on what throughout the project and ensure that you meet the determined project budget.

As is the case with all management plans, the aim of the cost management plan is to help us to meet the project's goals and objectives as a whole.

### What Should Be Included in a Cost Management Plan?
There are 6 items that should be included in a cost management plan.

#### 1. Unit of Measure
You will estimate costs based on the amount of a material you need. These units might change depending on the country or project. Units of measure are critical to determining and estimating the cost of a project so must be included.

#### 2. Levels of Precision
Levels of precision must be included in the cost management plan as well. For instance, what will be the number of decimal places during calculations?

This might come to you as a trivial point, but if you consider mega-projects, millions of materials can be used and the level of precision might cause significant variances in total.

#### 3. Control Thresholds
An agreed-upon amount of cost variation before action needs to be taken. For instance, what will be the amount of budget variance to take action to get back on track?

If you are managing a $1 million project, and if you set $20,000 as the control threshold, this means you need to take corrective actions if you are more than $20,000 behind the schedule/plan.

#### 4. Rules of Performance Measurement
__Earned value management__ technique or __percent completion method__ for activities must be included in the cost management plan.

Earned value management is the most common technique used to measure cost-performance of a project, and is abbreviated as __EVM__.

The percent completion method for activities must be included in the cost management plan as well.

For instance, how do you consider an activity in progress? Generally, there are 3 assumptions for activities in progress:
* The first approach considers them as not started.
* the second approach considers them as 50% complete.
* The third approach considers them as 100% completed.

How activities in progress will be considered must be included in the cost-management plan.

#### 5. Reporting Formats
* How frequently will you be reporting the cost/performance of the project?
* What will be the format for cost reporting?

For instance, you will report a brief high-level cost report to senior management every 2 weeks and a detailed report once a month. These must be stated in the cost-management plan.

#### 6. Additional Details
Additional details such as funding choices, cost recording procedures etc must be included in the cost management plan as well.

In case you need additional budget for your project, how to find sources should be mentioned in the cost management plan.

If there are corporate tools or applications that keep track of costs and expenses in a project, these must be described in the cost management plan as well.

### Example - Construction Project
To use the example of a construction project, several civil engineers and construction workers will work. Various materials such as cement, wood, steel will be needed and tools such as trucks, bulldozers, hammers will also be needed.
