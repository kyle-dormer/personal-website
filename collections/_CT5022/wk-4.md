## Project Planning Process
Planning is an interative process that is critical for the project's success. This is because it is where the project manager defines and documents and project details. Furthermore, the planning process allows the project manager to develop all the necessary planning documents.

### Planning Documents
* Work Breakdown Structure (WBS)
* Project Schedule
* Budget
* Risk Response Plan
* Communication Plan

## Project Planning Steps 
Project planning is performed through a series of six steps that utilise a number of project management techniques:
* Preparing or planning activities
* Develop a work breakdown structure (WBS)
* Develop a deliverable list and task list
* Estimate effort and duration
* Develop project schedule
* Identify cost
* Identify, assess and respond to risks
* Develop communication documents
* Develop project plan
* Obtain sponsor's approval

### Step 1: Prepare for Planning
The project manager begins the planning process by reviewing:
* the project charter
* project request
* project defininition
* project proposal

#### How to Create a Project Charter
1. Understand project goals and objectives.
2. Define project organisation.
3. Create an implementation plan.
4. List potential problem areas.

#### Project Request
Project requests define proposed projects so that managers:
1. Can evaluate how well they support an organisation's strategy.
2. Can determine if the costs and benefits are acceptable.
3. Can determine if the costs and benefits are acceptable.

### Step 2: Develop a Work Breakdown Structure (WBS)
Developing a WBS is the process of identifying high-level deliverables and then decomposing them into smaller, more manageable components. The WBS can be a simple hierarchy showing only __major deliverables__.

#### The WBS Defined
The WBS is a tool for breaking a project down into its component parts. Building a WBS helps to:
* Illustrate project scope
* Create schedule
* Cost estimates
* Assign resources
* Provide a basis for control

It is a top down decomposition of deliverables, where each descending level represents an increasingly detailed definition of the project work.

#### Guidelines for Developing a WBS
* Deliverable should be expressed as nouns.
* Each WBS element should represent a single tangible deliverable.
* If a deliverable is broken down, it should contain at least two sub or interim deliverables.
* The same deliverable may not be listed twice.
* Ownership should be assigned at the lowest level, and only one person should be assigned to the deliverable.
* The WBS does not contain tasks.
* You should stop breaking down the work when you reach a level low enough to estimate the effort and cost.

#### WBS Example

#### WBS vs Project Schedule vs Project Plan
__Work breakdown structure__ describes the deliverables needed to complete the project i.e. the _what_ of the project. It doesn't include timelines or resourcs. The goal of the WBS is to give the project team a hyper-focused idea of what they need to achieve.

__Project schedule__ describes the project's deliverables as well as their deadlines and resource requirements. Think of it as the _what_, _when_ and _who_ of the project.

__Project plan__ is an expansive document covering virtually every aspect of the project and its management. It includes details on how the project will be executed, managed and controlled. It usually has several constituent plans governing communications, risk management, change management etc.

#### Benefits of Creating a WBS
* It defines and organises the work required.
* It can be used to identify potential scope risks if it has a branch that is not well defined.
* It provides a visual of entire scope.
* It can show control points and milestones.
* It can be used to show and assign accountabilities and responsibilities.
* It can assist with resource allocation.

Furthermore:

__Project schedule__ &mdash; the WBS is the foundation of the project schedule and budget. Once you know all the deliverables required to complete the project, as well as their hierarchical relationships, it will be much easier to assign resources and set deadlines.

__Accountability__ &mdash; since all elements in a WBS are mutually exclusive, it helps create accountability. A team assigned to a single work package is  wholly accountable for its completion.

__Commitment__ &mdash; the WBS gives teams a very high-level overview of their responsibilities. Since each team is responsible for a specific component at a time it helps make them more commited to completing their assigned tasks.

__Reduces ambiguities__ &mdash; the process of developing the WBS involves the project manager, project team and all relevant stakeholders. This encourages dialog and helps everyone involved flesh out their responsibilities. Thus, everyone has less ambiguity and a better idea of what they're supposed to do.
