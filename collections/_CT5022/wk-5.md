## Time Planning
Accurate time estimation is a skill essential good project management. It is important to get time estimates right for two main reasons:
* Time estimates often determine the pricing of contracts and hence the profitability of the contract/project in commercial terms.
* Time estimates drive the setting of deadlines for delivery and planning of projects, and hence will impcat other peoples' assessment of your reliability and competence as a project manager.

## Step 1: Understand the Project Outcome
First you need to fully understand what it is you need to achieve. 

Then, review the project/task in detail so that there are no _unknowns_. Some difficult-to-understand, tricky problems that take the greatest amount of time to solve.

The best way to review the job is to just list all component tasks in full detail.

## Step 2: Estimate Time
When you have a detailed list of all the tasks that you must achieve to complete the project then you can begin to estimate how long each will take.

Make sure that you have allowed time for project management administration, detailed project, liasion with outside bodies' resources and authorities, meetings, quality assurance developing supporting documentation or procedures necessary and training.

Allow time for:
* Other high urgency tasks to be carried out which will have priority over this one.
* Accidents and emergencies.
* Internal/external meetings.
* Holidays with sickness in key staff/stakeholders.
* Contact with other customers, suppliers and contractors.
* Breakdowns in equipment.
* Missed deliveries by suppliers.
* Interruptions by customers, suppliers, contractors, family, pets, co-workers etc.
* Other priorities and schedules, e.g. local government planning processes.
* Quality control rejections.
* Unanticipated events (e.g. renovating the bathroom finding white-ants/termites in the walls).

## Step 3: Plan for it Going Wrong
Finally, allow time for all the expected and unexpected disruptions and delays to work that will inevitably happen. Sickness, strikes, materials not being available, poor quality work, bureaucratic bungling etc.

## How to Estimate Project Time and Resources
When a project manager is presented with a project and asked "can you do this?", "how long will it take?", "how many resources will you require?"

1. "I think so".
2. To answer the other two questions, he will need time.

To calculate the time and resources needed to complete a project the following factors must be known:
1. The number of tasks needed to complete.
2. The duration of those tasks.
3. The number of team members working on those tasks.

### Top-Down Approach
The Top-Down approach works well if the project is clearly defined, has a clear end-goal and there are previous examples of such projects that a PM can use as a guideline.

All this information allows a PM to quickly define the major tasks and break those down into smaller chunks of daily tasks.

This approach is suited for when you don't have a lot time to answer the ultimate question "how long will it take?", at the same time, have a lot of data to work with.

### Bottom-Up Approach
The bottom-up method is considered to be the most accurate method for generating project estimates.

It is used to determine budget or definitive estimates suing the planning phase and at the start of each project stage.

The method uses the Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) developed during the planning phase of the project. Estimates are created for all tasks at the lowest level of the WBS and then these are accumulated to determine the estimates for the whole project.

Experts with the skills required to perform the work should be including in the estimating process.

One disadvantage is that it is much more time-consuming than other methods.

#### Bottom-Up Activity Estimation Example

## Gantt Chart
* The Gantt chart is an alternative presentation to the project plan.
* Logical links are indicated by the use of arrows.
* The head of the arrow points to an activity that cannot proceed until the activity at the tail of the arrow is completed.
* The diamond shapes on the chart are used to indicate _milestones_ (important points in the life of the project, in this case the start and hand-in dates).

### Pros
* Simple to draw and read
* Good for static environments
* Useful for providing overview of project activities.
* Very widely used.
* The basis of the graphical interface for most PM software.

### Cons
* Difficult to update manually where there are many changes - charts can quickly become obsolete and therefore discredited.
* Does not equate time with cost.
* Does not help in optimising resource allocation.

## How to Estimate Durations?
There are six main tools when estimating project activity durations:
1. Analogous estimating
2. Parametric estimating
3. Expert judgement
4. Three-point estimating
5. Group decision making
6. Reserve analysis

### Analogous Estimating
Analogous estimating is also known as _top-down estimation_. It is a relatively simple technique that involves leveraging the estimator's past experience or historical data from previous projects by adopting observed cost, duration or resource needs to a current project or portions of a project. Analogous estimating does not require data manipulation or statistical adjustments.

This technique is primarily used to produce estimates without having plenty of information available. This may be the caes during project selection or initiation phases, when overseeing a bunch of projects at the portfolio-level, or in the early stages of a project.

Analogous estimating is typically used to get 4 types of estimates:
* a single-point or absolute value estimate &mdash; single absolute value such as $100,000
* a ratio estimate &mdash; describes the relative application of historical data or experience to a current project. One form is estimating by applying a factor to observed historical values - e.g. 125% of the time of the previous project.
* an estimate range &mdash; comprises of a range of possible values rather than a single number. Often accompanies by a most likely estimate.
* a three-point estimate &mdash; requires project manager or team to come up with three different estimates:
    * optimistic estimate
    * pessimistic estimate
    * most likely estimate

### Parametric Estimating
Parametrics estimating is a statistics-based technique to calculate the expected amount of financial resources or time that is required to complete a project or project activity. 

The determination of an estimate is based on a statistical (or assumed) correlation between a parameter and a cost or time value. This observed correlation is then scaled to the size of the current project.

For instance, in highway construction, the cost and time to build 1 mile in a previous project could be the basis for calculating the resources and schedule of the current construction project. However, this requires that there is statistical evidence of the correlation and if the characteristics of both the projects are comparable. 

To calculate the cost or duration per parameter, a set of historical data is required. This could be obtained from previous projects, publicly available market data or agencies that provide statistics for benchmarking.

### Expert Judgement
Expert Judgment is a technique in which judgment is provided based upon a specific set of criteria and/or expertise that has been acquired in a specific knowledge area, application area, or product area, a particular discipline, an industry, etc. Such expertise may be provided by any group or person with specialized education, knowledge, skill, experience, or training.

Expert Judgment is used for situations which require recourse to expert judgment by completing, validating, interpreting and integrating existing data, assessing the impact of a change, predicting the occurrence of future events and the consequences of a decision, determining the present state of knowledge in one field, providing the elements needed for decision-making in the presence of several options.

### Reserve Analysis
Analytical technique used to establish a schedule duration, any and all estimated costs, the budget, as ell as the complete funds assigned or allocated to the project.
