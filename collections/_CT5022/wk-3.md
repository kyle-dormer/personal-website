## The Project Management Process

### Process Overview
A project management methodology provides the structure and discipline for managing projects. Process involved in making movies might include:
* Screenwriting (initiating)
* Producing (planning)
* Acting and directing (executing)
* Editing (monitoring and controlling)
* Releasing the movie (closing)

Project managers in any field know how important it is to follow a good process.

## The Project Lifecycle

There are four main project management phases:
* __Initiating__ &mdash; activities conducted to start up the project.
* __Planning__ &mdash; activities to define the project in detail and determines how the project objectives will be achieved.
* __Controlling__ &mdash; activities to carry out the project's activities, measure and monitor progress and take corrective action when necessary.
* __Closing__ &mdash; activities to bring the project to an end.

## Project Initiation
The initiating process allows the project manager to define the project:
* Objectives
* Scope
* Assumptions
* Constraints
* Risk factors

It is important for the project manager to:
* Develop a relationship with the project sponsor(s).
* Discuss project management expectations.

The main goal of this phase is to formally select and start off projects.

### Initiation Steps
1. Obtain copies of pre-project documents.
2. Interview project sponsor and other stakeholders.
3. Prepare project charter.
4. Review project charter with stakeholders.
5. Obtain approval from project sponsor to begin planning.

#### Obtain Copies of Pre-Project Documents
The project manager should obtain copies of all pre-project documents. These documents will differ depending on an organisation's project selection and approval methodology. 

Alongside this, the project manager should obtain any documents that supply background information about the project.

#### Interview Project Sponsor and Other Stakeholders
The project sponsor __shares responsibility__ for project success and has ultimate sign-off authority for the project.

A key activity during the initiation phase is __information gathering__. During this, the project manager must determine the stakeholder's __needs__ and clarify their expectations - this is the time to find out what the stakeholders _really_ want.

The information gathered during this phase should be __documented__ and __shared__ with the project stakeholders.

#### Prepare Project Charter
The __project charter__ describes the project and serves as an agreement between the sponsor and the project manager.

The project manager prepares this document with direction from the project sponsor.


#### Review Project Charter with Stakeholders
The project manager distributes the initial draft of the project charter to key stakeholders to:
* Obtain feedback
* Build consensus

Based on this, the project manager updates the project charter (feedback) and distributes it to the appropriate stakeholders.

#### Obtain Approval from Project Sponsor to Begin Planning
The final initiating process step is to obtain approval from the project sponsor. If the project sponsor approves the project charter, the project manager can begin _planning_ the project activities.

## Project Planning
The main purpose of project planning is to __guide execution__. Every knowledge area includes planning information. Key outputs included in the project planning include:
* A team contract 
* A project scope statement
* A work breakdown structure (WBS)
* A project schedule, in the form of a Gantt chart with all dependencies and resources entered
* A list of prioritised risks (part of a risk register)

### Gantt Chart Example

## Project Executing
This stage is the most time and resource intensive:
* Project managers must use their __leadership skills__ to handle many challenges that occur during project execution.
* Many project sponsors and customers focus on deliverables related to providing the products, services of results desired from the project.
* A milestone report can help focus on completing major milestones.

### Milestone Report Example

## Project Monitoring and Controlling
* Involves measuring progress toward project objectives, monitoring deviation from the plan, and taking corrective actions.
* Affects all other process groups and occurs during all phases of the project life-cycle.
* Outputs include performance reports, requested changes and updates to various plans.

## Project Closing
* Involves gaining stakeholder and customer acceptance of the final product(s) and/or service(s).
* Even if projects are not completed, they should be closed out to _learn from past experiences_.
* Outputs include project archives and lessons learned, part of organisational process assets.
* Most projects also include a __final report__ and __presentation__ to the sponsor/senior management.

## Summary
* __Project initiation request__ &mdash; formalises the commitment to explore further a problem, need or opportunity and captures the context.
* __Business case__ &mdash; captures the reasoning behind the project, provides justification and establishes the budgetary constraints.
* __Project charter__ &mdash; builds on the business case and defines the project scope and the high-level requirements and deliverables.
* __Project handbook__ &mdash; presents the project management objectives and the overall management approach, and documents the roles and responsibilities.
* __Project work plan__ &mdash; includes a breakdown of the work to be carried out, estimates of the effort and costs involved and the project schedule.
* __Project deliverable__ &mdash; the complete set of a project's deliverables as defined in the Project Charter and the Project Work Plan.
* __Project End-Report__ &mdash; summarises the project experience, project performance, lessons learned and both successful project practises and pitfalls.
