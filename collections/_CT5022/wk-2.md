## Recap
Project is temporary:
* defined beginning
* defined end
* therefore __defined scope and resources__

Project is unique:
* not a routine operation
* specific set of operations to accomplish a singular goal

With this in mind, _project management_ is the application of knowledge, skills, tools and techniques to project activities to _meet the project requirements_.

## Project Management Processes
1. Initiating
2. Planning
3. Executing
4. Monitoring and Controlling
5. Closing

### Project Management Knowledge Draws on Ten Areas
1. __Integration__ (management) &mdash; the umbrella that covers all other project management knowledge areas.
2. __Scope__ (management) &mdash; refers to the total amount of work that must be done in order to deliver a product, service, or result with specified functions and features.
3. __Time__ (management) &mdash; processes involved with ensuring project meets deadline.
4. __Cost__ (management) &mdash; process of estimating, budgetting and controlling the project's costs.
5. __Quality__ (management) &mdash; process of continually ensuring the quality of all work done is up to scratch.
6. __Procurement__ (management) &mdash; process of managing project's budget for goods, services and resources required for completing the project.
7. __Human resources__ (management) &mdash; managing and assigning team members to appropriate tasks to work towards finished project.
8. __Communications__ (management) &mdash; process of collecting and distributing the project's information and data.
9. __Risk management__ (management) &mdash; process of mitigating potential unforeseen events affecting the project's cost or deadline.
10. __Stakeholder__ (management) &mdash; process of communicating the project's status and costs to relevant stakeholders as well as managing their expectations.

## Project Managers
Project managers play the lead role in planning, executing, monitoring, controlling, and closing projects.
They are the ones _accountable_ for the entire project scope, project team resources and whether the project succeeds or fails. 

Project managers can be found in every type of organisation as:
* employees
* managers
* contractors
* independent consultants

Ideally, they are passionate and _goal-oriented_ people who draw on their experience to understand what projects have in common. 

Furthermore, they should be able to work _well under pressure_ as well as being comfortable with change and complexity in dynamic environments.

Alongside these skills, however, project managers also need good people skills to ensure _trust_ and _good communication_ amongst a project's team and stakeholders.

### Core Values
#### Impact
>Project management is a critical competence that has a positive influence on organisation results and society.<br>

#### Professionalism
>Accountability and ethical behaviour ensures our commitment to stakeholders.

## Common Project Terms
* __Deliverables__: Tangible 'things' that the project produces.
* __Milestones__: Dates by which major activities are performed.
* __Tasks__: Also called _actions_. Activities undertaken during the project.
* __Risks__: Potential problems that may arise.
* __Issues__: Risks that have already manifested.
* __Gantt Chart__: A specific type of chart showing time and tasks. Usually created by a project management program such as MS project.
* __Stakeholder__: Any person or group of people who may be affected by your project.

## Work-Breakdown Structure
WBS is the process of breaking work down into smaller, readily achievable tasks on the macro scale of a project. Each task is broken into smaller tasks that can be managed and estimated - in terms of estimation as well as cost.

Alongside this, it defines _task dependencies_ whereby some tasks rely on the completion of other tasks before they can be started/finished.

## Characteristics of Projects
* A project contains a well-defined objective. The project objective is defined in terms of scope (or requirements), schedule and cost.
* A project is carried out via a set of interdependent tasks.
* A project uses various resources to carry out these tasks.
* A project has a definite start date and an expected completion date. The actual completion date may not always be the same as the expected date.
* A project has a customer/client.

### Why Do Projects Fail?
* Poor project and program management discipline. 
* Lack of executive-level support.
* Wrong team members - not qualified or suited for job.
* Poor communication - whether between team or between project manager and stakeholders.
* No measures for evaluating the success of the project.
* No risk management.
* Inability to manage change/complexity.

### Measuring Project Success
We measure the success of a project using 4 major project constraints, specifically:
* Scope &mdash; have all the project requirements (deliverables) been completed?
* Cost &mdash; is the cost of the project close to the amount the customer has agreed to pay?
* Schedule (time) &mdash; was the project completed on time?
* Customer satisfaction (quality & performance) &mdash; is the customer happy with the quality of the project?

### How Does the Project Get Started? 
If you have an idea for a project and need to document your idea in order to get approved, the _project request_ is an excellent tool.

## Project Request
* The person that is trying to get their project approved completes the _project request form_.
* The project request is then submitted to the decision-maker or approval committee.
* The decision-maker will determine whether or not to proceed with the project.
* The decision-maker will indicate when the project can begin.
